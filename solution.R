# This R-file provides the solution to the challenge as provided by Optiver
# The challenge goes as follows:
#   Calvin has to cross several signals when he walks from his home to school. 
#   Each of these signals operate independently. They alternate every 80 seconds 
#   between green light and red light. At each signal, there is a counter display 
#   that tells him how long it will be before the current signal light changes. 
#   Calvin has a magic wand which lets him turn a signal from red to green 
#   instantaneously. However, this wand comes with limited battery life, so he can 
#   use it only for a specified number of times.

#   Can you write a script that takes as inputs the number of signals and the number 
#   of times Calvin can use his magic wand, and outputs the expected waiting time?
